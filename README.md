Cold Storage Management System

The Cold Storage Management System is designed to efficiently manage inventory, track goods, and maintain customer details for cold storage facilities. It automates the manual processes involved in storing and retrieving goods, ensuring accuracy, time-saving, and proper record keeping. The system provides features like inventory management, customer record handling, check-in and check-out tracking, report generation, and user authentication for secure access. It is built using Java as the backend, with MySQL/SQLite as the database, and can be run on any IDE such as VS Code, IntelliJ, or Eclipse.

The project folder contains the source code files (Java classes like Main, Database, Inventory, and Customer), database scripts for table creation and data storage, and supporting assets such as icons or images. To run the project, clone the repository, open it in your preferred IDE, and set up the database by importing the provided SQL script. Update the database connection details in the Database.java file, compile the Main.java file, and execute it to start the system.

Once running, the system allows admins or staff to log in securely, add or manage customer details, record goods stored in and out of the cold storage, and generate reports for monitoring usage and performance. Its user-friendly interface makes it accessible to users with minimal technical knowledge. The project is open for contributions, and others can fork the repository and submit pull requests to improve features. This project is licensed under the MIT License.
